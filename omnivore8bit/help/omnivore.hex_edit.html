<h1>Hex Editor</h1>
<div class="toctree-wrapper compound">
<ul class="simple">
</ul>
</div>
<a name="overview"></a>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The hex editor was designed for reverse engineering 6502 machine code,
initially for the Atari 8-bit computer systems, but expanded to Apple ][
and other 6502-based processors. There is also support for most other 8-bit
processors, but as the author doesn&#8217;t have experience with other 8-bit
processors they have not been extensively tested.</p>
<p>Opening a file to edit will present the main hex edit user interface that
shows many different views of the data. Editing is supported in the hex
view, character view, and the disassembly. There is also a bitmap view but
is presently only for viewing, not editing.</p>
<a name="viewing-data"></a>
<h3>Viewing Data</h3>
<p>The various views can be scrolled independently, but there is only one
cursor location. Clicking on a location in one view will move the other
views to show the same location. <a class="reference internal" href="#selections">Selections</a> are analogous; see below.</p>

<a name="segments"></a>
<h3>Segments</h3>
<p>Binary data is parsed using code that started life as part of Omnivore but
I spun it out because it&#8217;s useful as a standalone library: <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/atrcopy/">atrcopy</a>. It knows a lot about Atari 8-bit
files and disk images, knows some stuff about Apple ][ files and disk
images, and knows almost nothing about anything else (yet). Atrcopy thinks
of binary data in terms of <em>segments</em>, where a segment is simply a portion
of the disk image.</p>
<p>The interesting feature of atrcopy is due to the use of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>, and it&#8217;s this: segments can provide views of the
same data <em>in different orders</em>. And, changing a byte in one segment also
changes the value in other segments that contain that byte because there is
only one copy of the data.</p>
<p>This turns out to be super useful. For instance, the first segment that
appears in Omnivore&#8217;s list of segments will contain all the data from the
disk image, in the order that the bytes appear in the file. This may or may
not mean much depending on the format of the image. As an example, the
catalog of an Apple DOS 3.3 disk is stored in sectors that increment
downwards, so the catalog appears backwards(-ish. It&#8217;s complicated). So
atrcopy goes further and breaks this disk image segment into smaller
segments depending on the type of the file. In the catalog example above,
it creates another segment that displays the catalog in the correct order.
Changing a byte in either of those segments will change the value in the
other, because it&#8217;s really the same value. It&#8217;s just two different looks
into the same data.</p>

<a name="editing-data"></a>
<h3>Editing Data</h3>
<p>Hex data can be edited by:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>clicking on a cell and changing the hex data</li>
<li>selecting a region (or multiple regions; see <a class="reference internal" href="#selections">Selections</a> below) and using one of the operations in the <a class="reference internal" href="#bytes-menu">Bytes Menu</a></li>
<li>cutting and pasting hex data from elsewhere in the file</li>
<li>cutting and pasting hex data from another file edited in a different tab or window</li>
<li>pasting in data from an external application.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Character data can be edited by clicking on a character in the character
map to set the cursor and then typing. Inverse text is supported for Atari
modes. Also supported are all the selection and cut/paste methods as above.</p>

<a name="baseline-data"></a>
<h3>Baseline Data</h3>
<p>Omnivore automatically highlights changes to each segment as compared to
the state of the data when first loaded.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can specify a baseline difference file to compare to a
different set of data, like a canonical or reference image. This is useful
to compare changes to some known state over several Omnivore editing
sessions, as Omnivore will remember the path to the reference image and
will reload it when the disk image is edited in the future.</p>
<p>As data is changed, the changes as compared to the baseline will be
displayed in red.</p>
<p>By default, baseline data difference highlighting is turned on, you can
change this with the <a class="reference internal" href="#show-baseline-differences">Show Baseline Differences</a> menu item.</p>

<a name="selections"></a>
<h3>Selections</h3>
<p>Left clicking on a byte in any of the data views (hex, char, disassembly,
bitmap, etc.) and dragging the mouse with the button held down will start a
new selection, finished by releasing the mouse button. The selection will
be shown in all views of the data, scrolling each view independently if
necessary.</p>
<p>The selection may be extended by shift-left-click, extending
from either the beginning or the end of the selection as appropriate.</p>
<p>Multiple selections are supported by holding the Control key (Command on
Mac) while clicking and dragging as above. Extending a selection when using
multiple selection is not currently supported.</p>

<a name="find"></a>
<h3>Find</h3>
<p>The data is searchable in multiple ways. Starting any search will display a
search bar on the bottom of the main window. The basic search bar available
with the <a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">`Find`_</span></a> menu item tries to be flexible and will show matches in
any data view using an appropriate conversion for that view. For instance,
the text string &#8220;00&#8221; in the search bar will find values of 0 in the hex
view, strings of &#8220;00&#8221; in the character view, labels that have &#8220;00&#8221; anywhere
in their text, &#8220;00&#8221; as an operand in the disassembly, or anything that has
&#8220;00&#8221; in a comment.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#find-next">Find Next</a> and <a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9">`Find Prev`_</span></a> menu items (or keyboard shortcuts) will
traverse the list of matches.</p>
<p>A more complicated search can be performed using the <a class="reference internal" href="#find-using-expression">Find Using
Expression</a> menu item that support ranges of addresses or specific data
values as search parameters using arbitrary boolean expressions.</p>

<a name="comments"></a>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Comments are a hugely important part of reverse engineering, because by
definition the original source has been lost (or was never available). As
you figure things out, it&#8217;s important to write things down. Omnivore
supports adding a comment to any byte in the file, and it will appear in
any segment that views that byte.</p>
<p>In the sidebar is a big ol&#8217; list of comments, and selecting one of the
comments will move the data views to display the byte that is referenced by
that comment. Because there may be multiple views of the same byte, the
comment shown in the comments list is the <em>first</em> segment that contains
that comment.</p>
<p>Note that segments must have a defined origin for the segment to be
considered as the primary for that comment.</p>

<a name="disassembler"></a>
<h3>Disassembler</h3>
<p>Omnivore started out as a reverse engineering tool for Atari 8-bit
computers, which use the 6502 processor. After developing for a while, I
found a python disassembler called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jefftranter/udis">udis</a> that supports multiple processors.
Through its usage, Omnivore can disassemble (and assemble! See below) code
for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>6502</li>
<li>65816</li>
<li>65c02</li>
<li>6800</li>
<li>6809</li>
<li>6811</li>
<li>8051</li>
<li>8080</li>
<li>z80</li>
</ul>
<p>but the 6502 is the only processor have direct knowledge of and so the only
one I&#8217;ve tested thoroughly. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/robmcmullen/omnivore/issues">Bug reports</a> (and patches!) for
the other processors are welcome.</p>
<a name="mini-assembler"></a>
<h4>Mini-Assembler</h4>
<p>The disassembly can be edited using a simple mini-assembler; clicking on an
opcode provides a text entry box to change the command. The mini-assembler
supports all CPU types, not just 6502.</p>

<a name="labels"></a>
<h4>Labels</h4>
<p>Labels can be set on an address, and the label will be reflected in the
disassembly code. Also, memory mapping files can be supplied that
automatically label operating system locations.</p>

<a name="data-regions"></a>
<h4>Data Regions</h4>
<p>To support reverse engineering, regions can be marked as data, code, ANTIC
display lists, and other types. Regions are highlighted in a different
style and changes how the disassembly is displayed.</p>

<a name="static-tracing-of-disassembly"></a>
<h4>Static Tracing of Disassembly</h4>
<p>To help identify regions, static tracing can be used. Turning on static
tracing assumes that every byte is data and shows temporary highlights over
the entire segment. Starting a trace at an address causes Omnivore to
follow the path of execution until it hits a return, break or bad
instruction, marking every byte that it traverses as code. It will also
follow both code paths at any branch. This is not an emulator, however, so
it is not able to tell if there is any self-modifying code. Any blocks of
code that aren&#8217;t reached will require additional traces. When tracing is
finished, the results can be applied to the segment to mark as data or
code.</p>



<a name="file-menu"></a>
<h2>File Menu</h2>
<a name="new"></a>
<h3>New</h3>
<p>A list of supported file types that can be created by Omnivore.</p>

<a name="code"></a>
<h4>Code</h4>
<p>Marks the selected bytes as valid code to be disassembled using the
current processor definition.</p>

<a name="data"></a>
<h4>Data</h4>
<p>Marks the selected bytes as data, not to be disassembled but shown
as byte values in the disassembly listing.</p>

<a name="uninitialized-data"></a>
<h4>Uninitialized Data</h4>
<p>Marks the selected bytes as unitialized data, skipping over those bytes
and placing an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">origin</span></code> directive in the disassembly that points to the
next address that contains any other type of data.</p>

<a name="display-list"></a>
<h4>Display List</h4>
<p>Marks the selected bytes as an ANTIC display list, which will be shown
as data in the disassembly listing. The data will be grouped by ANTIC
command, where all bytes that belong to a command will be on a single line.
This can result in a large number of data bytes appearing on one line when
displaying a graphics 8 display list, for example. Exporting the
disassembly will produce listings that break up these long lines into
normal amounts, defaulting to 4 bytes on a line.</p>

<a name="jumpman-level-data"></a>
<h4>Jumpman Level Data</h4>
<p>Marks the selected bytes as Jumpman drawing element descriptors. This is
not used much for direct editing now that the <a class="reference external" href="omnivore.jumpman.html">Jumpman Level Editor</a> is
available.</p>

<a name="jumpman-harvest-table"></a>
<h4>Jumpman Harvest Table</h4>

<a name="memory-map"></a>
<h3>Memory Map</h3>
<p>In the disassembly window, target addresses for jumps, branches, loads,
stores, compares, etc. can be replaced by text labels that are defined for
the particular platform. For example, on the Atari 8-bit platform,
occurrences of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$E459</span></code> will be replaced by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SIOV</span></code>.</p>
<p>Some platforms like the Atari 8-bits have hardware locations that perform
different functions depending on whether it is read from or written to. The
disassembler can handle this, so reading the location <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$D000</span></code> will show
the label <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M0PF</span></code> (missile 0 to playfield collisions) while writing will
show <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HPOSP0</span></code> (set the horizontal position of player 0).</p>
<p>Currently supported platforms are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No Memory Map</li>

<p>Changes the view in the entire window to a new editing task. The files in the current task are not lost, it&#8217;s just a way to edit different types of files while using the same top level window on the desktop.</p>


<a name="bytes-menu"></a>
<h2>Bytes Menu</h2>
<p>The commands in this menu operate on the current selection to change the byte values to:</p>
<a name="zero-bytes"></a>

<h3>Right Shift</h3>
<p>Shift bits right (divide by 2), inserting zeros in the high bit</p>

<a name="left-rotate"></a>
<h3>Left Rotate</h3>
<p>Shift bits left where the high bit wraps around to become the new low bit</p>

<a name="right-rotate"></a>
<h3>Right Rotate</h3>
<p>Shift bits right where the low bit wraps around to become the new high bit</p>

<a name="reverse-bits"></a>
<h3>Reverse Bits</h3>
<p>Reverse the bit pattern of each byte; e.g. $c0 or 11000000 in binary becomes 00000011 in binary, $03 in hex</p>

<a name="add"></a>
<h3>Add</h3>
<p>Adds the user specified value to the data, performing a logical AND with
$ff if necessary to keep all values in the 8-bit range.</p>

<a name="subtract"></a>
<h3>Subtract</h3>
<p>Subtracts the user specified value from the data (AND with $ff if
necessary). Note the difference between this and <a class="reference internal" href="#subtract-from">Subtract From</a></p>

<a name="subtract-from"></a>
<h3>Subtract From</h3>
<p>Subtracts the data from the user specified value (AND with $ff if
necessary). Note the difference between this and <a class="reference internal" href="#subtract">Subtract</a></p>

<a name="multiply"></a>
<h3>Multiply</h3>
<p>Multiply the data from the user specified value (AND with $ff if
necessary).</p>

<a name="divide-by"></a>
<h3>Divide By</h3>
<p>Divides the data by the user specified value by the data, ignoring the
remainder. Note the difference between this and <a class="reference internal" href="#divide-from">Divide From</a></p>

<a name="divide-from"></a>
<h3>Divide From</h3>
<p>Divides the data from the user specified value (that is to say: dividing
the user specified value by the data), ignoring the remainder. Note the
difference between this and <a class="reference internal" href="#divide-by">Divide By</a></p>

<a name="ramp-up"></a>
<h3>Ramp Up</h3>
<p>Starting with the user specified value at the first selected byte, loops
over each byte in the selection and adds one to the value of the previous
byte. At $ff, it wraps around to $00.</p>

<a name="ramp-down"></a>
<h3>Ramp Down</h3>
<p>Starting with the user specified value at the first selected byte, loops
over each byte in the selection and subtracts one from the value of the
previous byte. At $00, it wraps around to $ff.</p>


<a name="segment-menu"></a>
<h2>Segment Menu</h2>
<a name="view-segment"></a>
<h3>View Segment</h3>
<p>This submenu contains a list of all segments in the disk image.
Selecting one of these items will change the view to the selected segment.</p>

<a name="new-segment-from-selection"></a>
<h3>New Segment From Selection</h3>
<p>Create a new segment in the segment list using the current selection.</p>
<p>All the bytes in the current selection will be shown in the new segment. If
there are multiple selections, the new segment will show the bytes as
contiguous but they will represent the original locations in the disk
image.</p>

<a name="multiple-segments-from-selection"></a>
<h3>Multiple Segments From Selection</h3>
<p>Create a set of segments from the current selection, given the desired
length of the resulting segments. If the number of bytes in the selection
is not an exact multiple of the specified length, the last segment created
will contain the remaining bytes. It will not be padded with zeros.</p>

<a name="interleave-segments"></a>
<h3>Interleave Segments</h3>
<p>Create new segment by interleaving segments</p>

<a name="set-segment-origin"></a>
<h3>Set Segment Origin</h3>
<p>Sets the origin of the current segment to an address, changing the
starting point for all windows displaying this segment&#8217;s data.</p>

<a name="add-comment"></a>
<h3>Add Comment</h3>
<p>Add a text comment to a byte location.</p>
<p>A comment is associated with a single byte, so although a range can be
selected, the comment is applied to only the first byte in the range.</p>
<p>Bytes with comments will be highlighted in all displays.</p>

<a name="remove-comment"></a>
<h3>Remove Comment</h3>
<p>Remove any comments that are in the selected range, or if no selection
from the current cursor position.</p>

<a name="add-label"></a>
<h3>Add Label</h3>
<p>Add a label to a byte location.</p>
<p>Like <a class="reference internal" href="#add-comment">Add Comment</a>, a label is associated with a single byte, so although
a range can be selected, the comment is applied to only the first byte in
the range.</p>
<p>Unlike comments, labels are <em>not</em> highlighted and are only shown in the
disassembly window.</p>

<a name="remove-label"></a>
<h3>Remove Label</h3>
<p>Remove the label at the current cursor position, or if there is a
selection, all labels in the selected range.</p>

<a name="manage-segment-labels"></a>
<h3>Manage Segment Labels</h3>
<a name="import"></a>
<h4>Import</h4>
<p>Imports a text file that defines labels and addresses.</p>
<p>The text file should contain the address and the label on a single line.
It&#8217;s pretty generous about parsing the input; there are two major types recognized.</p>
<p>The first is typical assembler format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; = &lt;address&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>where the address can be in decimal without a prefix or in hex with the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0x</span></code> prefix.</p>
<p>and the second is a line with a hex value first and the label following.
Any line without an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code> character is parsed this way, such that the first
thing that lookslike a hex or decimal number is used as the address, and
the first thing after that that looks like a valid text string is used as
the label. It can be comma separated, space separated, tab separated, etc;
anything but <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code>.</p>

<a name="export-user-defined-labels"></a>
<h4>Export User Defined Labels</h4>
<p>Exports a text file containing label/address pairs.</p>
<p>The text file will have a format that can be included in most assemblers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; = $&lt;hex address&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SIOV = $E459
SETVBV = $E45C
</pre></div>


<a name="export-all-labels"></a>
<h4>Export All Labels</h4>
<p>Exports a text file containing label/address pairs.</p>
<p>The text file will have a format that can be included in most assemblers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; = $&lt;hex address&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SIOV = $E459
SETVBV = $E45C
</pre></div>



<a name="start-new-disassembly-trace"></a>
<h3>Start New Disassembly Trace</h3>

<a name="add-trace-start-point"></a>
<h3>Add Trace Start Point</h3>
<p>Start a trace at the cursor or at all instructions in the selected ranges</p>

<a name="apply-trace-to-segment"></a>
<h3>Apply Trace to Segment</h3>
<p>Copy the results of the trace to the current segment</p>

<a name="clear-trace"></a>
<h3>Clear Trace</h3>
<p>Clear the current trace</p>

<a name="run-emulator"></a>
<h3>Run Emulator</h3>
<p>Run the current emulator using the current emulator.</p>
<p>The current emulator is shown in the <a class="reference internal" href="#emulators">Emulators</a> sub-menu.</p>

<a name="emulators"></a>
<h3>Emulators</h3>
<p>This submenu contains a list of the known emulators and a checkbox
to indicate the current emulator.</p>
<a name="add-new-emulator"></a>
<h4>Add New Emulator</h4>
<p>Open up a window to define a reference to an external emulator</p>
<p>Omnivore can run the disk image in any emulator that is capable of being
started from a command line. It spawns a separate process and feeds the
emulator a path to the disk image along with any necessary command line
arguments that you have to specify when setting up the emulator in this
window.</p>

<a name="edit-emulators"></a>
<h4>Edit Emulators</h4>
<p>Make changes to the current list of emulators.</p>
<p>This opens a window with a list of the currently defined emulators
to make changes to existing emulators or add/delete any already defined.</p>

<a name="id5"></a>
<h4>Set Current as System Default</h4>
<p>The currently specified emulator in the <a class="reference internal" href="#emulators">Emulators</a> list will be set as
the system default and remembered for subsequent editing sessions.</p>


<a name="expand-disk-image"></a>
<h3>Expand Disk Image</h3>
<p>Resize the document to add extra data at the end</p>

<a name="add-baseline-difference-file"></a>
<h3>Add Baseline Difference File</h3>
<p>Open a window to select a <a class="reference internal" href="#baseline-data">Baseline Data</a> file.</p>
<p>The absolute path to the baseline file is stored, so if the baseline file
is moved to a new location you will have to use this command again to point
to the new location.</p>

<a name="find-next-difference"></a>
<h3>Find Next Difference</h3>
<p>Move the cursor to the next block of data that is different than
the <a class="reference internal" href="#baseline-data">Baseline Data</a> file.</p>
<p>This will wrap around to the beginning of the segment if it doesn&#8217;t find a
difference before the end.</p>

<a name="find-previous-difference"></a>
<h3>Find Previous Difference</h3>
<p>Move the cursor to the previous block of data that is different than
the <a class="reference internal" href="#baseline-data">Baseline Data</a> file.Data</p>
<p>This will wrap around to the end of the segment if it doesn&#8217;t find a
difference before the beginning.</p>

<a name="list-differences"></a>
<h3>List Differences</h3>
<p>Show a text representation of the differences</p>

<a name="goto-address"></a>
<h3>Goto Address</h3>
<p>Move the cursor to an address. If the address is in this segment, moves
there. If not, it searches through all the segments (in segment list order)
to find one that does contain that address.</p>
<p>If that address is not valid for any segment, it will return an error
message.</p>


<a name="documents-menu"></a>
<h2>Documents Menu</h2>
<p>This menu contains a list of all documents open in the current session, across all windows and tabs. Selecting an item in this list will switch the view to that document, using the editor that was being used the last time it was edited.</p>

<a name="window-menu"></a>
<h2>Window Menu</h2>
<a name="new-view-in"></a>
<h3>New View In</h3>
<p>This menu will contain a list of all editors that can modify this file. Selecting an item in this list will add a new view into this file using the selected editor.  For instance, you can have a map editor and a hex editor on the same file; they point to the same data and modifying data in one window will show up in the other window.</p>

<a name="new-window"></a>
<h3>New Window</h3>
<p>Open a new, blank Omnivore window that can be used to load new files
or to provide a second view on a currently loaded file.</p>


<a name="help-menu"></a>
<h2>Help Menu</h2>
<a name="about"></a>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Display window with version number and author info</p>

<a name="user-guide"></a>
<h3>User Guide</h3>
<p>Display the user guide in a new window</p>

<a name="open-log-directory-in-file-manager"></a>
<h3>Open Log Directory in File Manager</h3>
<p>Open the log directory in the desktop file manager program.</p>
<p>The log directory will contain debug logs (if enabled) and other files,
most of which are generally only useful for developers or to get more
information to send to the developers in the event of a problem.</p>

<a name="show-debug-log"></a>
<h3>Show Debug Log</h3>
<p>Displays a window that can be used to turn on debugging of particular
parts of the program.</p>
<p>The log levels shown initially are the default log levels for each logger.
Using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Filter</span></code> text entry box, you can enter a string or a comma
separated list of strings that will be used to select which loggers get
switched to <em>DEBUG</em> mode. Everything else gets set to its default state,
usually either <em>INFO</em> or <em>WARNING</em>.</p>
<p>The string is not a regular expression, but will match partial strings.</p>

<a name="more-debugging"></a>
<h3>More Debugging</h3>
<a name="widget-inspector"></a>
<h4>Widget Inspector</h4>
<p>Open the wxPython Widget Inspector</p>

<a name="raise-exception"></a>
