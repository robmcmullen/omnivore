<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Map edit mode provides a tile-based editor, capable of handling
scrolling playfields much wider than the screen.</p>
<p>Currently it has mostly been testing with Getaway! level editing, but it
can edit arbitrary maps. It needs a segment that exactly fits the
dimensions of the map, so some number of bytes wide times the number of
rows. If it does recognize the disk image as a Getaway! disk, it will set
up some extra features.</p>
<p>Selecting a segment will then show the map on a scrolling window. There are
tools available in the toolbar, such as line and rectangle drawing, that
can help speed up the process of creating areas. Cut and paste of
rectangular areas is supported. The basic usage of the draw tools is to
select a tile and use that as the drawing tile for whatever shape was
selected. Holding down the left mouse button while moving extends the shape
and releasing the mouse ends the shape. Full undo/redo support is
available.</p>
<p>In addition to the main map window, there is a drawing toolbar and three
supporting panes, all of which are described below.</p>
<a name="getaway"></a>
<h3>Getaway</h3>
<p>I interviewed Mark Reid in <a class="reference external" href="https://playermissile.com/podcast/ep019.html">Player/Missile episode 19</a> and he subsequently
located the original floppy disks containing his original source code. He
generously placed the code in the public domain, and I have set up a
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/robmcmullen/getaway">github repository</a> to further
development.</p>
<p>Wade of the <a class="reference external" href="https://inverseatascii.info">Inverse ATASCII</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://1632podcast.info">1632
Atari PodcaST</a> created the first new map for
Getaway using the map editor in Omnivore. He discovered some limitations
with custom maps that the original game didn&#8217;t handle because the original
game wasn&#8217;t meant to have different maps. For instance, the hideout was
hardcoded in a certain position, and the game would freeze if a cop reached
a dead end because the original game didn&#8217;t have any dead ends.</p>
<p>AtariAge user itaych fixed those bugs that caused custom maps to freeze the
game, and I added the ability to place the hideout at any location.</p>


<a name="toolbar"></a>
<h2>Toolbar</h2>
<p>Choosing any tool on the toolbar palette keeps that mode active until a new
toolbar icon is selected.</p>
<a name="selection"></a>
<h3>Selection</h3>
<p>The default mode is selection. Click the left button to place the cursor at
a location, and drag while holding down the left button to select a
rectangular region.</p>
<p>Multiple selection is supported: hold down the Control key (Command on Mac)
while clicking and dragging and new rectangular areas can be selected.</p>

<a name="tile-picker"></a>
<h3>Tile Picker</h3>
<p>This mode will set the current drawing tile from a location on the screen.
Click the left mouse button on a tile and that tile will be highlighted in
the <a class="reference internal" href="#tile-map">Tile Map</a> and the <a class="reference internal" href="#character-set">Character Set</a>, and therefore will be used as the
current drawing tile.</p>

<a name="freehand-drawing"></a>
<h3>Freehand Drawing</h3>
<p>The current tile will be used to replace the tile at the mouse pointer
location when the left button is held down.</p>

<a name="line-drawing"></a>
<h3>Line Drawing</h3>
<p>To start drawing a line with the current tile, left click on the starting
location and hold the mouse button. As you move the mouse, a preview of the
line will be drawn between the starting location and the current mouse
position. When you release the mouse button, the line will be copied to the
map.</p>

<a name="square"></a>
<h3>Square</h3>
<p>The process for drawing a square is much the line: left click on a point
(this will become a corner) and hold the mouse button while you choose a
point that will become the opposite corner. Like the line, it is a preview
until you release the button, whereupon it will be copied to the map.</p>
<p>The border is one tile wide, and the interior is not filled.</p>

<a name="filled-square"></a>
<h3>Filled Square</h3>
<p>This is the same the square above, except the interior is filled with the
tile.</p>


<a name="character-set"></a>
<h2>Character Set</h2>
<p>From this grid of all 256 possible tiles, you can select a tile to use as
the drawing pattern. All of the drawing commands in the toolbar above will
use the selected tile.</p>
<p>For the Atari, it includes the inverse characters in the second 128
positions.</p>

<a name="tile-map"></a>
<h2>Tile Map</h2>
<p>This pane also shows tiles, but in this case they are grouped together in
sections. Use the drop-down list at the top to choose a section, which will
scroll the tiles belonging to that section into view.</p>
<p>So far, this is only used for Getaway maps, and it is hardcoded. Eventually
there will be a way to define custom sections.</p>

<a name="overview-map"></a>
<h2>Overview Map</h2>
<p>This is a small version of the map, showing a view at one pixel per
character. Note that the page map is just greyscale; it uses the tile
number (i.e. the byte value) at a particular location as the intensity.</p>

<a name="file-menu"></a>
<h2>File Menu</h2>
<a name="new"></a>
<h3>New</h3>
<p>A list of supported file types that can be created by Omnivore.</p>
<p>Choosing an item in this list will open up a new tab in the current window
showing a new blank template of the selected file format.</p>
<p>Available templates include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Apple DOS 3.3 (140K) AUTOBRUN image</li>
<li>Apple DOS 3.3 (140K) blank image</li>
<li>Atari DOS 2 DD (180K) blank image</li>
<li>Atari DOS 2 ED (130K) blank image</li>
<li>Atari DOS 2 SD (90K) blank image</li>
<li>Atari DOS 2.0S SD (90K) system disk</li>
<li>Atari DOS 2.5 ED (130K) system disk</li>
<li>Getaway Map</li>

<a class="reference internal" href="#preferences">Preferences</a> dialog.</p>

<a name="insert-file"></a>
<h3>Insert File</h3>
<p>Insert binary data at the cursor</p>
<p>The data from the loaded file will overwrite data starting at the cursor,
so it&#8217;s not inserted in the text editor sense where space is created in the
existing data.</p>

<a name="save"></a>
<h3>Save</h3>
<p>Save the file, overwriting the previously saved version</p>

<a name="save-as"></a>
<h3>Save As</h3>

<h3>Export as Boot Disk</h3>
<p>Create an Atari 8-bit boot disk from a set of segments.</p>
<p>Opens a dialog window providing a list of segments to be added to the boot
disk and a starting address at which the Atari will begin executing the
program after reading all the sectors written to disk.</p>
<p>This creates a smaller-than-normal ATR image with a custom bootloader. Any
sectors beyond the number fo sectors required to create the image are not
included in the image.</p>
